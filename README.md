# Assembly End Game ðŸŽ®

A React-based word guessing game built as the final capstone project for the [Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/).

**Gameplay:**  
You have 8 chances to guess a random word, one letter at a time. Each wrong guess removes a programming language from the list... until only *Assembly Language* remains. Hence the name â€” *Assembly End Game*.

**Live Demo:** [assemblysendgame.netlify.app](https://assemblysendgame.netlify.app/)

**What I learned:**  
- React state & props  
- Event handling  
- Conditional rendering  
- Component-based design  
- Deploying React apps on Netlify

Iâ€™m continuing to build more React projects â€” feedback is always welcome! ðŸš€
